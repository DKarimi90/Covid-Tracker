## Project Description 
In this project, we were required to create a React application that helps track real-time covid data updates. This was meant to help inform travelers about COVID-19 status from across the world. 
## Project SetUp 
IN order to use this project, it is required that you install node to your local environment. Running the project will require you to clone it to your local environment. Next, run the command `npm install` to ensure that you have all the required dependencies. Lastly, run `npm start` to launch the application onto the browser. 
## Minimum Viable Product (MIV)
We were required to meet five core deliverables in this project as enumerated below. 
Users should:
